\title{
Simulated Survival and Hazard Analysis for time-dependent
}
\description{
SimHaz package in R to generate power for the Cox proportional hazards model by simulating 
survival events data with time dependent exposure status for subjects. A dichotomous exposure variable is considered with a single transition from unexposed to exposed status during the subject time's on study.

# Specifically, set the duration of the study to be 24 months; the median time to
# event for control group to be 24 months; exposure effect to be 0.3; median time
# to censoring to be 14 months; and exposure proportion to be 20%.
